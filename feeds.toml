  Unfortunately, this feed only covers ~75% of all public transportation (as of 4/2020), mainly because some regional providers are still not included. If this is insufficient for you, consider using the german NETEX feed, which has a higher coverage, or manually combine <a href="https://gtfs.mfdz.de/">available regional feeds</a>. Furthermore, the official feed is hidden behind a login form, so the download URL points to a community mirror, which doesn't have any official SLAs.
